                <p class="font-weight300">Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS) has been working in the fields of disaster relief &amp; school education for more than 30 years. BJS' largest &amp; longest running venture, the Wagholi Educational Rehabilitation Centre (WERC) in Pune,
                    has been running a complete educational, physical &amp; psycho-social rehabilitation of disaster affected children from different parts of the country. Presently, BJS is running a program Empowering the Next Generation (ENG). This
                    program supports student beneficiaries from drought hit regions of Maharashtra which are affected by farmer suicides. Currently 277 children affected by farmer suicides are being cared for in this WERC facility. This program is run
                    specifically for students between Std V &amp; Std XII. Simultaneously, 312 children from the impoverished tribal regions of Melghat &amp; Thane in Maharashtra are also part of this rehabilitation program in WERC. The overall goal of
                    the project is to educate and capacitate the children of farmer suicides so as to transform them to become the 'change agents' of their own community.

                    <p class="font-weight300">We believe that good education is the bedrock of a good life for individuals and societies. As agreed by the nations of the world through the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, school education should enable the full development
                        of the child&#39;s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities, and prepare the child for responsible life, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples. Unfortunately,
                        with 1.4 million schools in the country, meeting these fundamental aims of education is a daunting task. A mass education system like ours focuses on quantity rather than quality, and attainment of grades rather than acquisition
                        of values, attitudes and competencies required to be a good citizen. We believe it is our responsibility as a civil society organization to change this situation.</p>

                                    his energies and resources to work in the areas of school education, social change, and disaster response and rehabilitation. To give an organizational platform for work in these areas, he founded the Bharatiya Jain
