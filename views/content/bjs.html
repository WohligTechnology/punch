        <div class="desc mb60 pad20 margin60">
          <p class="font-weight300">We believe that good education is the bedrock of a good life for individuals and societies. As agreed by the nations of the world through the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, school education should enable the full development of
            the child&#39;s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities, and prepare the child for responsible life, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and friendship among all peoples. Unfortunately, with
            1.4 million schools in the country, meeting these fundamental aims of education is a daunting task. A mass education system like ours focuses on quantity rather than quality, and attainment of grades rather than acquisition of values, attitudes
            and competencies required to be a good citizen. We believe it is our responsibility as a civil society organization to change this situation.</p>

                  Beed district of Maharashtra, on August 15, 1954, he overcame several personal challenges to establish himself in business. After a successful career in business, he decided to use all his energies and resources to work in the areas
                  of school education, social change, and disaster response and rehabilitation. To give an organizational platform for work in these areas, he founded the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS) in 1980 and headed it till the end of 2013. A secular
                  NGO with a national network, BJS has several achievements to its credit.</p>
